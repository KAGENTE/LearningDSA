# LearningDSA
Some algorithms i made while studying DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS.
for now my objective are to get good at it then proceed to do some leetcode problems.
those studies are made based on the "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java 2024" video from the Telusko channel on youtube.
first i watch the explanation of how it works, then try to recrate it and if it fails watch the code part from the video.
TO DO: 
-Add the swap method to the other methods that use it.
-keep adding algorithms to all types of data structures.
-keep this repository updated with git commands.
