# LearningDSA
<p>Some algorithms i made while studying DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS.<br>
for now my objective are to get good at the logic of it then proceed to do some leetcode problems.<br>
those studies are made based on the "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java 2024" video from the Telusko channel on youtube.<br>
first i watch the explanation of how it works, then try to recrate it and if it fails watch the code part from the video.<br>
heap sort was based on the "Aula 16 - Algoritmo Heap Sort - Estruturas de Dados com Java" video from the leguariano channel on youtube
TO DO: <br>
-Add the swap method to the other methods that use it.âœ…<br>
-keep adding algorithms to all types of data structures. ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡µ<br>
-keep this repository updated with git commands. ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡µ<br>
-review the algorithms and update then with new skills. ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡µ</p>
